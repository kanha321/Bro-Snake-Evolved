# Bro-Snake-Evolved
The old nokia snake game, recreated in Kotlin. This snake game is originally created by [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6e6qjJ8JQ) (in java), but that was only a basic snake game

## How is it different from Bro Code's snake game?
#### First let see what features does Bro Code's snake game have:
- Snake can move in 4 directions
- Snake can eat food
- Snake can die if it hits the wall or itself
- Snake can grow when it eats food

#### That's it..., It was a very basic snake game. So I decided to add some more features to it:

## New Features added: (From Nokia, of course) [@Releases](https://github.com/kanha321/Bro-Snake-Evolved/releases)
