# Bro-Snake-Evolved
The old nokia snake Game, recreated in Kotlin. This snake Game is originally created by [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6e6qjJ8JQ) (in java), but that was only a basic snake Game

## How is it different from Bro Code's snake Game?
#### First let see what features does Bro Code's snake Game have:
- Snake can move in 4 directions
- Snake can eat food
- Snake can die if it hits the wall or itself
- Snake can grow when it eats food

#### That's it..., It was a very basic snake Game. So I decided to add some more features to it:

## New Features added: (From Nokia, of course)

- Changed: Bye Bye Java, Now it's Kotlin (completely rewritten in Kotlin)
- Added: png icons for small and big apples
- Added: Snake can go through the walls and appear on the other side instead of just dying
- Added: big bonus apple after every 5 apples eaten
- Added: Bonus apple timer at the bottom of the screen
- Added: Score system (will be improved in future)
- Added: The faster you eat the bonus apple, the more points you get
- Added: WASD key inputs for movement along with arrow keys
- Added: Death animation (snake will shrink and that body part will turn red)
- Fixed: Apples will not appear on the snake's body
- Fixed: x and y array max length

- Following new key inputs are added:
  - P: Pause/Resume the Game
  - Space: Restart the Game after Game over
  - Esc: Exit the Game
  - F2: Restart the Game at any time

And many more under the hood changes and bug fixes...

## Features To be added
- A new Game over screen with the following features:
  - Shows the highest score with your score
  - Shows the number of apples eaten
  - Shows the number of bonus apples eaten
  

- Game menu screen at start with the following features:
  - New Game
  - Resume Game (maybe)
  - High scores
  - Speed Adjustments
  - Exit Game


This is gonna improve a lot in the future...
