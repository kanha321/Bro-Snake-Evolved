[02:25 PM 14/Dec/2023] v2.0.0 beta 1.0.3
    added Forms correctly (I think)
    now forms are Panels instead of JFrame
    next step is to add Panel switching
    game part is not touched it should work (I guess)

[05:37 PM 14/Dec/2023] v2.0.0 beta 1.1.0    ---    (☺☻ Panel Manager ☻☺)
    added PanelManager which creates a stack of panels to easily switch between them
    added PanelHandler which handles the basic operations of panel (only because panels are written in java)

    next step is to add HighScore feature and then settings part
